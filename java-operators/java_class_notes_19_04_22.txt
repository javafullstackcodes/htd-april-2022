A class is a logic Entity (Because it represents logic of APP).
An Object is physical Entity (Because it contains memory).
A class is a blue print or template using which we can develop code of APP.
An Object is an Entity which gets created using class and it represents the state and behaviours.
Where state indicates variables(datamembers) and behaviourindicates methods(member function).

Ex: class Student
{
//variables
// methods
}
